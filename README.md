Just a teacher trying to break into the tech industry!
I've been a teacher for 2.5 years now and I'm big on blending tech into education. My recent projects are part of my efforts to continue doing so.
- 👀 I’m interested in fullstack development!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Vue.js, PHP, SQL
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web apps that would welcome contributions from a newbie!
